    <p class="letter">”I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it’s these things I’d believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn’t all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything.” – F. Scott Fitzgerald </p>

<div class="letter2-container">
    <p class="letter">I love you for all of the good mornings, good nights, from all your insecurities to all of your strengths. I want you to know you make me so happy and I will never regret that I chose to love you and commit. No matter what happens, I will always choose to understand and care for you even if times get tough. I am a better person because of our relationship and mainly because of you, I am so inspired to become the best version of myself so that I can treat you the best and I hope you feel the same way too. You will always be in my mind 24/7 and I will always love you. - Yel (P.S All the bad things you say about yourself, I love all of them so just show every side of you and I will accept all of them so dont be scared to be honest or open up. MWAH HEHE ) </p>
